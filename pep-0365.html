<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id2">Abstract</a></h1>
<p>This PEP proposes adding an enhanced version of the <tt class="docutils literal">pkg_resources</tt>
module to the standard library.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">pkg_resources</tt> is a module used to find and manage Python
package/version dependencies and access bundled files and resources,
including those inside of zipped <tt class="docutils literal">.egg</tt> files.  Currently,
<tt class="docutils literal">pkg_resources</tt> is only available through installing the entire
<tt class="docutils literal">setuptools</tt> distribution, but it does not depend on any other part
of setuptools; in effect, it comprises the entire runtime support
library for Python Eggs, and is independently useful.</p>
<p>In addition, with one feature addition, this module could support
easy bootstrap installation of several Python package management
tools, including <tt class="docutils literal">setuptools</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">workingenv</tt>, and <tt class="docutils literal">zc.buildout</tt>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="proposal">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id3">Proposal</a></h1>
<p>Rather than proposing to include <tt class="docutils literal">setuptools</tt> in the standard
library, this PEP proposes only that <tt class="docutils literal">pkg_resources</tt> be added to the
standard library for Python 2.6 and 3.0.  <tt class="docutils literal">pkg_resources</tt> is
considerably more stable than the rest of setuptools, with virtually
no new features being added in the last 12 months.</p>
<p>However, this PEP also proposes that a new feature be added to
<tt class="docutils literal">pkg_resources</tt>, before being added to the stdlib.  Specifically, it
should be possible to do something like:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
python -m pkg_resources SomePackage==1.2
</pre>
<p>to request downloading and installation of <tt class="docutils literal">SomePackage</tt> from PyPI.
This feature would <em>not</em> be a replacement for <tt class="docutils literal">easy_install</tt>;
instead, it would rely on <tt class="docutils literal">SomePackage</tt> having pure-Python <tt class="docutils literal">.egg</tt>
files listed for download via the PyPI XML-RPC API, and the eggs would
be placed in the <tt class="docutils literal">$PYTHON_EGG_CACHE</tt> directory, where they would
<strong>not</strong> be importable by default.  (And no scripts would be installed.)
However, if the download egg contains installation bootstrap code, it
will be given a chance to run.</p>
<p>These restrictions would allow the code to be extremely simple, yet
still powerful enough to support users downloading package management
tools such as <tt class="docutils literal">setuptools</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">workingenv</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">zc.buildout</tt>,
simply by supplying the tool's name on the command line.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="rationale">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4">Rationale</a></h1>
<p>Many users have requested that <tt class="docutils literal">setuptools</tt> be included in the
standard library, to save users needing to go through the awkward
process of bootstrapping it.  However, most of the bootstrapping
complexity comes from the fact that setuptools-installed code cannot
use the <tt class="docutils literal">pkg_resources</tt> runtime module unless setuptools is already
installed. Thus, installing setuptools requires (in a sense) that
setuptools already be installed.</p>
<p>Other Python package management tools, such as <tt class="docutils literal">workingenv</tt> and
<tt class="docutils literal">zc.buildout</tt>, have similar bootstrapping issues, since they both
make use of setuptools, but also want to provide users with something
approaching a &quot;one-step install&quot;.  The complexity of creating bootstrap
utilities for these and any other such tools that arise in future, is
greatly reduced if <tt class="docutils literal">pkg_resources</tt> is already present, and is also
able to download pre-packaged eggs from PyPI.</p>
<p>(It would also mean that setuptools would not need to be installed
in order to simply <em>use</em> eggs, as opposed to building them.)</p>
<p>Finally, in addition to providing access to eggs built via setuptools
or other packaging tools, it should be noted that since Python 2.5,
the distutils install package metadata (aka <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">PKG-INFO</span></tt>) files that
can be read by <tt class="docutils literal">pkg_resources</tt> to identify what distributions are
already on <tt class="docutils literal">sys.path</tt>.  In environments where Python packages are
installed using system package tools (like RPM), the <tt class="docutils literal">pkg_resources</tt>
module provides an API for detecting what versions of what packages
are installed, even if those packages were installed via the distutils
instead of setuptools.</p>

<div class="section" id="implementation-and-documentation">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5">Implementation and Documentation</a></h1>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">pkg_resources</tt> implementation is maintained in the Python
SVN repository under <tt class="docutils literal">/sandbox/trunk/setuptools/</tt>; see
<tt class="docutils literal">pkg_resources.py</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">pkg_resources.txt</tt>.  Documentation for the
egg format(s) supported by <tt class="docutils literal">pkg_resources</tt> can be found in
<tt class="docutils literal">doc/formats.txt</tt>.  HTML versions of these documents are available
at:</p>
