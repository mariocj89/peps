<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id3">Abstract</a></h1>
<p>The process of including a new package into the Python standard library is
hindered by the API lock-in and promise of backward compatibility implied by
a package being formally part of Python.  This PEP describes a methodology
for marking a standard library package &quot;provisional&quot; for the period of a single
feature release.  A provisional package may have its API modified prior to
&quot;graduating&quot; into a &quot;stable&quot; state.  On one hand, this state provides the
package with the benefits of being formally part of the Python distribution.
On the other hand, the core development team explicitly states that no promises
are made with regards to the stability of the package's API, which may
change for the next release.  While it is considered an unlikely outcome,
such packages may even be removed from the standard library without a
deprecation period if the concerns regarding their API or maintenance prove
well-founded.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="proposal-a-documented-provisional-state">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4">Proposal - a documented provisional state</a></h1>
<p>Whenever the Python core development team decides that a new package should be
included into the standard library, but isn't entirely sure about whether the
package's API is optimal, the package can be included and marked as
&quot;provisional&quot;.</p>
<p>In the next feature release, the package may either be &quot;graduated&quot; into a normal
&quot;stable&quot; state in the standard library, remain in provisional state, or be
rejected and removed entirely from the Python source tree.  If the package ends
up graduating into the stable state after being provisional, its API may
be changed according to accumulated feedback.  The core development team
explicitly makes no guarantees about API stability and backward compatibility
of provisional packages.</p>
<div class="section" id="marking-a-package-provisional">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5">Marking a package provisional</a></h2>
<p>A package will be marked provisional by a notice in its documentation page and
its docstring. The following paragraph will be added as a note at the top of
the documentation page:</p>
<blockquote>
The &lt;X&gt; package has been included in the standard library on a
provisional basis.  Backwards incompatible changes (up to and including
removal of the package) may occur if deemed necessary by the core
developers.</blockquote>
<p>The phrase &quot;provisional basis&quot; will then be a link to the glossary term
&quot;provisional package&quot;, defined as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A provisional package is one which has been deliberately excluded from the
standard library's backwards compatibility guarantees.  While major
changes to such packages are not expected, as long as they are marked
provisional, backwards incompatible changes (up to and including removal of
the package) may occur if deemed necessary by core developers.  Such changes
will not be made gratuitously -- they will occur only if serious flaws are
uncovered that were missed prior to the inclusion of the package.</p>
<p>This process allows the standard library to continue to evolve over time,
without locking in problematic design errors for extended periods of time.
See <a class="reference external" href="/dev/peps/pep-0411">PEP 411</a> for more details.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following will be added to the start of the package's docstring:</p>
<blockquote>
The API of this package is currently provisional.  Refer to the
documentation for details.</blockquote>
<p>Moving a package from the provisional to the stable state simply implies
removing these notes from its documentation page and docstring.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="which-packages-should-go-through-the-provisional-state">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6">Which packages should go through the provisional state</a></h2>
<p>We expect most packages proposed for addition into the Python standard library
to go through a feature release in the provisional state. There may, however,
be some exceptions, such as packages that use a pre-defined API (for example
<tt class="docutils literal">lzma</tt>, which generally follows the API of the existing <tt class="docutils literal">bz2</tt> package),
or packages with an API that has wide acceptance in the Python development
community.</p>
<p>In any case, packages that are proposed to be added to the standard library,
whether via the provisional state or directly, must fulfill the acceptance
conditions set by <a class="reference external" href="/dev/peps/pep-0002">PEP 2</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="criteria-for-graduation">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id7">Criteria for &quot;graduation&quot;</a></h2>
<p>In principle, most provisional packages should eventually graduate to the
stable standard library.  Some reasons for not graduating are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The package may prove to be unstable or fragile, without sufficient developer
support to maintain it.</li>
<li>A much better alternative package may be found during the preview release.</li>
</ul>
<p>Essentially, the decision will be made by the core developers on a per-case
basis.  The point to emphasize here is that a package's inclusion in the
standard library as &quot;provisional&quot; in some release does not guarantee it will
continue being part of Python in the next release.  At the same time, the bar
for making changes in a provisional package is quite high.  We expect that
most of the API of most provisional packages will be unchanged at graduation.
Withdrawals are expected to be rare.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="rationale">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8">Rationale</a></h1>
<div class="section" id="benefits-for-the-core-development-team">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id9">Benefits for the core development team</a></h2>
<p>Currently, the core developers are really reluctant to add new interfaces to
the standard library.  This is because as soon as they're published in a
release, API design mistakes get locked in due to backward compatibility
concerns.</p>
<p>By gating all major API additions through some kind of a provisional mechanism
for a full release, we get one full release cycle of community feedback
before we lock in the APIs with our standard backward compatibility guarantee.</p>
<p>We can also start integrating provisional packages with the rest of the standard
library early, so long as we make it clear to packagers that the provisional
packages should not be considered optional.  The only difference between
provisional APIs and the rest of the standard library is that provisional APIs
are explicitly exempted from the usual backward compatibility guarantees.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="benefits-for-end-users">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id10">Benefits for end users</a></h2>
<p>For future end users, the broadest benefit lies in a better &quot;out-of-the-box&quot;
experience - rather than being told &quot;oh, the standard library tools for task X
are horrible, download this 3rd party library instead&quot;, those superior tools
are more likely to be just be an import away.</p>
<p>For environments where developers are required to conduct due diligence on
their upstream dependencies (severely harming the cost-effectiveness of, or
even ruling out entirely, much of the material on PyPI), the key benefit lies
in ensuring that all packages in the provisional state are clearly under
python-dev's aegis from at least the following perspectives:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Licensing:  Redistributed by the PSF under a Contributor Licensing Agreement.</li>
<li>Documentation: The documentation of the package is published and organized via
the standard Python documentation tools (i.e. ReST source, output generated
with Sphinx and published on <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.python.org">http://docs.python.org</a>).</li>
<li>Testing: The package test suites are run on the python.org buildbot fleet
and results published via <a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/dev/buildbot">http://www.python.org/dev/buildbot</a>.</li>
<li>Issue management: Bugs and feature requests are handled on
<a class="reference external" href="http://bugs.python.org">http://bugs.python.org</a></li>
<li>Source control: The master repository for the software is published
on <a class="reference external" href="http://hg.python.org">http://hg.python.org</a>.</li>
