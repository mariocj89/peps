<div class="section" id="introduction">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id2">Introduction</a></h1>
<p>When new modules were added to the standard Python library in the
past, it was not possible to foresee whether they would still be
useful in the future.  Even though Python &quot;Comes With Batteries
Included&quot;, batteries may discharge over time.  Carrying old modules
around is a burden on the maintainer, especially when there is no
interest in the module anymore.</p>
<p>At the same time, removing a module from the distribution is
difficult, as it is not known in general whether anybody is still
using it.  This PEP defines a procedure for removing modules from the
standard Python library.  Usage of a module may be 'deprecated', which
means that it may be removed from a future Python release.  The
rationale for deprecating a module is also collected in this PEP.  If
the rationale turns out faulty, the module may become 'undeprecated'.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="procedure-for-declaring-a-module-deprecated">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id3">Procedure for declaring a module deprecated</a></h1>
<p>Since the status of module deprecation is recorded in this PEP,
proposals for deprecating modules MUST be made by providing a change
to the text of this PEP, which SHOULD be a patch posted to
bugs.python.org.</p>
<p>A proposal for deprecation of the module MUST include the date of the
proposed deprecation and a rationale for deprecating it.  In addition,
the proposal MUST include a change to the documentation of the module;
deprecation is indicated by saying that the module is &quot;obsolete&quot; or
&quot;deprecated&quot;.  The proposal SHOULD include a patch for the module's
source code to indicate deprecation there as well, by raising a
DeprecationWarning.  The proposal MUST include patches to remove any
use of the deprecated module from the standard library.</p>
<p>It is expected that deprecated modules are included in the Python
release that immediately follows the deprecation; later releases may
ship without the deprecated modules.</p>
<div class="section" id="for-modules-existing-in-both-python-2-7-and-python-3-5">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4">For modules existing in both Python 2.7 and Python 3.5</a></h2>
<p>In order to facilitate writing code that works in both Python 2 &amp; 3
simultaneously, any module that exists in both Python 3.5 and
Python 2.7 will not be removed from the standard library until
Python 2.7 is no longer supported as specified by <a class="reference external" href="/dev/peps/pep-0373">PEP 373</a>. Exempted
from this rule is any module in the idlelib package as well as any
exceptions granted by the Python development team.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="procedure-for-declaring-a-module-undeprecated">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5">Procedure for declaring a module undeprecated</a></h1>
<p>When a module becomes deprecated, a rationale is given for its
deprecation.  In some cases, an alternative interface for the same
functionality is provided, so the old interface is deprecated.  In
other cases, the need for having the functionality of the module may
not exist anymore.</p>
<p>If the rationale is faulty, again a change to this PEP's text MUST be
submitted.  This change MUST include the date of undeprecation and a
rationale for undeprecation.  Modules that are undeprecated under this
procedure MUST be listed in this PEP for at least one major release of
Python.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="obsolete-modules">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6">Obsolete modules</a></h1>
<p>A number of modules are already listed as obsolete in the library
documentation.  These are listed here for completeness.</p>
<blockquote>
cl, sv, timing</blockquote>
<p>All these modules have been declared as obsolete in Python 2.0, some
even earlier.</p>
<p>The following obsolete modules were removed in Python 2.5:</p>
<blockquote>
addpack, cmp, cmpcache, codehack, dircmp, dump, find, fmt,
grep, lockfile, newdir, ni, packmail, Para, poly,
rand, reconvert, regex, regsub, statcache, tb, tzparse,
util, whatsound, whrandom, zmod</blockquote>
<p>The following modules were removed in Python 2.6:</p>
<blockquote>
gopherlib, rgbimg, macfs</blockquote>
<p>The following modules currently lack a DeprecationWarning:</p>
<blockquote>
rfc822, mimetools, multifile</blockquote>

<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id7">Deprecated modules</a></h1>
<pre class="literal-block">
Module name:   posixfile
Rationale:     Locking is better done by fcntl.lockf().
Date:          Before 1-Oct-2000.
Documentation: Already documented as obsolete.  Deprecation
               warning added in Python 2.6.

Module name:   gopherlib
Rationale:     The gopher protocol is not in active use anymore.
Date:          1-Oct-2000.
Documentation: Documented as deprecated since Python 2.5.  Removed
               in Python 2.6.

Module name:   rgbimgmodule
Rationale:     In a 2001-04-24 c.l.py post, Jason Petrone mentions
               that he occasionally uses it; no other references to
               its use can be found as of 2003-11-19.
Date:          1-Oct-2000
Documentation: Documented as deprecated since Python 2.5.  Removed
               in Python 2.6.

Module name:   pre
Rationale:     The underlying PCRE engine doesn't support Unicode, and
               has been unmaintained since Python 1.5.2.
Date:          10-Apr-2002
Documentation: It was only mentioned as an implementation detail,
               and never had a section of its own.   This mention
               has now been removed.

Module name:   whrandom
Rationale:     The module's default seed computation was
               inherently insecure; the random module should be
               used instead.
Date:          11-Apr-2002
Documentation: This module has been documented as obsolete since
               Python 2.1, but listing in this PEP was neglected.
               The deprecation warning will be added to the module
               one year after Python 2.3 is released, and the
               module will be removed one year after that.

Module name:   rfc822
Rationale:     Supplanted by Python 2.2's email package.
Date:          18-Mar-2002
Documentation: Documented as &quot;deprecated since release 2.3&quot; since
               Python 2.2.2.

Documentation: Documented as &quot;deprecated since release 2.3&quot; since
               Python 2.2.2.  Raises a DeprecationWarning as of
               Python 2.6.

Module name:   mimify
Rationale:     Supplanted by Python 2.2's email package.
Date:          18-Mar-2002
Documentation: Documented as &quot;deprecated since release 2.3&quot; since
               Python 2.2.2.  Raises a DeprecationWarning as of
               Python 2.6.

Module name:   rotor
Rationale:     Uses insecure algorithm.
Date:          24-Apr-2003
Documentation: The documentation has been removed from the library
               reference in Python 2.4.

               Removed from the library reference in Python 2.4.

Module name:   statcache
Rationale:     Using the cache can be fragile and error-prone;
               applications should just use os.stat() directly.
Date:          10-Aug-2004
Documentation: This module has been documented as obsolete since
               Python 2.2, but listing in this PEP was neglected.
               Removed from the library reference in Python 2.5.

Module name:   mpz
Rationale:     Third-party packages provide similar features
               and wrap more of GMP's API.
Date:          10-Aug-2004
Documentation: This module has been documented as obsolete since
               Python 2.2, but listing in this PEP was neglected.
