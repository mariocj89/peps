<div class="section" id="abstract">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4">Abstract</a></h1>
<p><a class="reference external" href="/dev/peps/pep-0484">PEP 484</a> introduced type hints, a.k.a. type annotations.  While its
main focus was function annotations, it also introduced the notion of
type comments to annotate variables:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
# 'primes' is a list of integers
primes = []  # type: List[int]

# 'captain' is a string (Note: initial value is a problem)
captain = ...  # type: str

class Starship:
    # 'stats' is a class variable
    stats = {}  # type: Dict[str, int]
</pre>
<p>This PEP aims at adding syntax to Python for annotating the types of variables
(including class variables and instance variables),
instead of expressing them through comments:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
primes: List[int] = []

captain: str  # Note: no initial value!

class Starship:
    stats: ClassVar[Dict[str, int]] = {}
</pre>
<p><a class="reference external" href="/dev/peps/pep-0484">PEP 484</a> explicitly states that type comments are intended to help with
type inference in complex cases, and this PEP does not change this
intention.  However, since in practice type comments have also been
adopted for class variables and instance variables, this PEP also
discusses the use of type annotations for those variables.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="rationale">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5">Rationale</a></h1>
<p>Although type comments work well enough, the fact that they're
expressed through comments has some downsides:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Text editors often highlight comments differently from type annotations.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">There's no way to annotate the type of an undefined variable; one needs to
initialize it to <tt class="docutils literal">None</tt> (e.g. <tt class="docutils literal">a = None # type: int</tt>).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Variables annotated in a conditional branch are difficult to read:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
if some_value:
    my_var = function() # type: Logger
else:
    my_var = another_function() # Why isn't there a type here?
</pre>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Since type comments aren't actually part of the language, if a Python script
wants to parse them, it requires a custom parser instead of just using
<tt class="docutils literal">ast</tt>.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Type comments are used a lot in typeshed. Migrating typeshed to use
the variable annotation syntax instead of type comments would improve
readability of stubs.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">In situations where normal comments and type comments are used together, it is
difficult to distinguish them:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
path = None  # type: Optional[str]  # Path to module source
</pre>
</li>
<li><p class="first">It's impossible to retrieve the annotations at runtime outside of
attempting to find the module's source code and parse it at runtime,
which is inelegant, to say the least.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The majority of these issues can be alleviated by making the syntax
a core part of the language. Moreover, having a dedicated annotation syntax
for class and instance variables (in addition to method annotations) will
pave the way to static duck-typing as a complement to nominal typing defined
by <a class="reference external" href="/dev/peps/pep-0484">PEP 484</a>.</p>
<div class="section" id="non-goals">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6">Non-goals</a></h2>
<p>While the proposal is accompanied by an extension of the <tt class="docutils literal">typing.get_type_hints</tt>
standard library function for runtime retrieval of annotations, variable
annotations are not designed for runtime type checking. Third party packages
will have to be developed to implement such functionality.</p>
<p>It should also be emphasized that <strong>Python will remain a dynamically typed
language, and the authors have no desire to ever make type hints mandatory,
even by convention.</strong> Type annotations should not be confused with variable
declarations in statically typed languages. The goal of annotation syntax is
to provide an easy way to specify structured type metadata
for third party tools.</p>
<p>This PEP does not require type checkers to change their type checking
rules. It merely provides a more readable syntax to replace type
comments.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="specification">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id7">Specification</a></h1>
<p>Type annotation can be added to an assignment statement or to a single
expression indicating the desired type of the annotation target to a third
party type checker:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
my_var: int
my_var = 5  # Passes type check.
other_var: int  = 'a'  # Flagged as error by type checker,
                       # but OK at runtime.
</pre>
<p>This syntax does not introduce any new semantics beyond <a class="reference external" href="/dev/peps/pep-0484">PEP 484</a>, so that
the following three statements are equivalent:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
var = value # type: annotation
var: annotation; var = value
var: annotation = value
</pre>
<p>Below we specify the syntax of type annotations
in different contexts and their runtime effects.</p>
<p>We also suggest how type checkers might interpret annotations, but
compliance to these suggestions is not mandatory.  (This is in line
with the attitude towards compliance in <a class="reference external" href="/dev/peps/pep-0484">PEP 484</a>.)</p>
<div class="section" id="global-and-local-variable-annotations">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8">Global and local variable annotations</a></h2>
<p>The types of locals and globals can be annotated as follows:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
some_number: int           # variable without initial value
some_list: List[int] = []  # variable with initial value
</pre>
<p>Being able to omit the initial value allows for easier typing of variables
assigned in conditional branches:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
sane_world: bool
if 2+2 == 4:
    sane_world = True
else:
    sane_world = False
</pre>
<p>Note that, although the syntax does allow tuple packing, it does <em>not</em> allow
one to annotate the types of variables when tuple unpacking is used:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
# Tuple packing with variable annotation syntax
t: Tuple[int, ...] = (1, 2, 3)

# Tuple unpacking with variable annotation syntax
header: str
kind: int
body: Optional[List[str]]
header, kind, body = message
</pre>
<p>Omitting the initial value leaves the variable uninitialized:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
a: int
print(a)  # raises NameError
</pre>
<p>However, annotating a local variable will cause the interpreter to always make
it a local:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
def f():
    a: int
    print(a)  # raises UnboundLocalError
    # Commenting out the a: int makes it a NameError.
</pre>
<p>as if the code were:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
def f():
    if False: a = 0
    print(a)  # raises UnboundLocalError
</pre>
<p>Duplicate type annotations will be ignored. However, static type
checkers may issue a warning for annotations of the same variable
by a different type:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
a: int
a: str  # Static type checker may or may not warn about this.
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="class-and-instance-variable-annotations">
<span id="classvar"></span><h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id9">Class and instance variable annotations</a></h2>
<p>Type annotations can also be used to annotate class and instance variables
in class bodies and methods. In particular, the value-less notation <tt class="docutils literal">a: int</tt>
allows one to annotate instance variables that should be initialized
in <tt class="docutils literal">__init__</tt> or <tt class="docutils literal">__new__</tt>. The proposed syntax is as follows:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
class BasicStarship:
    captain: str = 'Picard'               # instance variable with default
    damage: int                           # instance variable without default
    stats: ClassVar[Dict[str, int]] = {}  # class variable
</pre>
<p>Here <tt class="docutils literal">ClassVar</tt> is a special class defined by the typing module that
indicates to the static type checker that this variable should not be
set on instances.</p>
<p>Note that a <tt class="docutils literal">ClassVar</tt> parameter cannot include any type variables, regardless
of the level of nesting: <tt class="docutils literal">ClassVar[T]</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ClassVar[List[Set[T]]]</span></tt> are
both invalid if <tt class="docutils literal">T</tt> is a type variable.</p>
<p>This could be illustrated with a more detailed example. In this class:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
class Starship:
    captain = 'Picard'
    stats = {}

    def __init__(self, damage, captain=None):
        self.damage = damage
        if captain:
            self.captain = captain  # Else keep the default

    def hit(self):
        Starship.stats['hits'] = Starship.stats.get('hits', 0) + 1
</pre>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">stats</tt> is intended to be a class variable (keeping track of many different
per-game statistics), while <tt class="docutils literal">captain</tt> is an instance variable with a default
value set in the class. This difference might not be seen by a type
checker: both get initialized in the class, but <tt class="docutils literal">captain</tt> serves only
as a convenient default value for the instance variable, while <tt class="docutils literal">stats</tt>
is truly a class variable -- it is intended to be shared by all instances.</p>
<p>Since both variables happen to be initialized at the class level, it is
useful to distinguish them by marking class variables as annotated with
types wrapped in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ClassVar[...]</span></tt>. In this way a type checker may flag
accidental assignments to attributes with the same name on instances.</p>
<p>For example, annotating the discussed class:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
class Starship:
    captain: str = 'Picard'
    damage: int
    stats: ClassVar[Dict[str, int]] = {}

    def __init__(self, damage: int, captain: str = None):
        self.damage = damage
        if captain:
            self.captain = captain  # Else keep the default

    def hit(self):
        Starship.stats['hits'] = Starship.stats.get('hits', 0) + 1

enterprise_d = Starship(3000)
enterprise_d.stats = {} # Flagged as error by a type checker
Starship.stats = {} # This is OK
</pre>
<p>As a matter of convenience (and convention), instance variables can be
annotated in <tt class="docutils literal">__init__</tt> or other methods, rather than in the class:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
from typing import Generic, TypeVar
T = TypeVar('T')

class Box(Generic[T]):
    def __init__(self, content):
        self.content: T = content
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="annotating-expressions">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id10">Annotating expressions</a></h2>
<p>The target of the annotation can be any valid single assignment
target, at least syntactically (it is up to the type checker what to
do with this):</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
class Cls:
    pass

c = Cls()
c.x: int = 0  # Annotates c.x with int.
c.y: int      # Annotates c.y with int.

d = {}
d['a']: int = 0  # Annotates d['a'] with int.
d['b']: int      # Annotates d['b'] with int.
</pre>
<p>Note that even a parenthesized name is considered an expression,
not a simple name:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
(x): int      # Annotates x with int, (x) treated as expression by compiler.
(y): int = 0  # Same situation here.
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="where-annotations-aren-t-allowed">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id11">Where annotations aren't allowed</a></h2>
<p>It is illegal to attempt to annotate variables subject to <tt class="docutils literal">global</tt>
or <tt class="docutils literal">nonlocal</tt> in the same function scope:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
def f():
    global x: int  # SyntaxError

def g():
    x: int  # Also a SyntaxError
    global x
</pre>
<p>The reason is that <tt class="docutils literal">global</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">nonlocal</tt> don't own variables;
therefore, the type annotations belong in the scope owning the variable.</p>
<p>Only single assignment targets and single right hand side values are allowed.
In addition, one cannot annotate variables used in a <tt class="docutils literal">for</tt> or <tt class="docutils literal">with</tt>
statement; they can be annotated ahead of time, in a similar manner to tuple
unpacking:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
a: int
for a in my_iter:
    ...

f: MyFile
with myfunc() as f:
    ...
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="variable-annotations-in-stub-files">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id12">Variable annotations in stub files</a></h2>
<p>As variable annotations are more readable than type comments, they are
preferred in stub files for all versions of Python, including Python 2.7.
Note that stub files are not executed by Python interpreters, and therefore
using variable annotations will not lead to errors. Type checkers should
support variable annotations in stubs for all versions of Python. For example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
# file lib.pyi

ADDRESS: unicode = ...

class Error:
    cause: Union[str, unicode]
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="preferred-coding-style-for-variable-annotations">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id13">Preferred coding style for variable annotations</a></h2>
<p>Annotations for module level variables, class and instance variables,
and local variables should have a single space after corresponding colon.
There should be no space before the colon. If an assignment has right hand
side, then the equality sign should have exactly one space on both sides.
Examples:
* Yes:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">

<div class="section" id="changes-to-standard-library-and-documentation">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id14">Changes to Standard Library and Documentation</a></h1>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A new covariant type <tt class="docutils literal">ClassVar[T_co]</tt> is added to the <tt class="docutils literal">typing</tt>
module. It accepts only a single argument that should be a valid type,
and is used to annotate class variables that should not be set on class
instances. This restriction is ensured by static checkers,
but not at runtime. See the
<a class="reference internal" href="#classvar">classvar</a> section for examples and explanations for the usage of
<tt class="docutils literal">ClassVar</tt>, and see the <a class="reference internal" href="#rejected">rejected</a> section for more information on
the reasoning behind <tt class="docutils literal">ClassVar</tt>.</li>
<li>Function <tt class="docutils literal">get_type_hints</tt> in the <tt class="docutils literal">typing</tt> module will be extended,
so that one can retrieve type annotations at runtime from modules
and classes as well as functions.
Annotations are returned as a dictionary mapping from variable or arguments
to their type hints with forward references evaluated.
For classes it returns a mapping (perhaps <tt class="docutils literal">collections.ChainMap</tt>)
constructed from annotations in method resolution order.</li>
<li>Recommended guidelines for using annotations will be added to the
documentation, containing a pedagogical recapitulation of specifications
described in this PEP and in <a class="reference external" href="/dev/peps/pep-0484">PEP 484</a>. In addition, a helper script for
translating type comments into type annotations will be published
separately from the standard library.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="runtime-effects-of-type-annotations">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id15">Runtime Effects of Type Annotations</a></h1>
<p>Annotating a local variable will cause
the interpreter to treat it as a local, even if it was never assigned to.
Annotations for local variables will not be evaluated:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
def f():
    x: NonexistentName  # No error.
</pre>
<p>However, if it is at a module or class level, then the type <em>will</em> be
evaluated:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
x: NonexistentName  # Error!
class X:
    var: NonexistentName  # Error!
</pre>
<p>In addition, at the module or class level, if the item being annotated is a
<em>simple name</em>, then it and the annotation will be stored in the
<tt class="docutils literal">__annotations__</tt> attribute of that module or class (mangled if private)
as an ordered mapping from names to evaluated annotations.
Here is an example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
from typing import Dict
class Player:
    ...
players: Dict[str, Player]
__points: int

print(__annotations__)
# prints: {'players': typing.Dict[str, __main__.Player],
#          '_Player__points': &lt;class 'int'&gt;}
</pre>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">__annotations__</tt> is writable, so this is permitted:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
__annotations__['s'] = str
</pre>
<p>But attempting to update <tt class="docutils literal">__annotations__</tt> to something other than an
ordered mapping may result in a TypeError:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
class C:
    __annotations__ = 42
    x: int = 5  # raises TypeError
</pre>
<p>(Note that the assignment to <tt class="docutils literal">__annotations__</tt>, which is the
culprit, is accepted by the Python interpreter without questioning it
-- but the subsequent type annotation expects it to be a
<tt class="docutils literal">MutableMapping</tt> and will fail.)</p>
<p>The recommended way of getting annotations at runtime is by using
<tt class="docutils literal">typing.get_type_hints</tt> function; as with all dunder attributes,
any undocummented use of <tt class="docutils literal">__annotations__</tt> is subject to breakage
without warning:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
from typing import Dict, ClassVar, get_type_hints
class Starship:
    hitpoints: int = 50
    stats: ClassVar[Dict[str, int]] = {}
    shield: int = 100
    captain: str
    def __init__(self, captain: str) -&gt; None:
        ...

assert get_type_hints(Starship) == {'hitpoints': int,
                                    'stats': ClassVar[Dict[str, int]],
                                    'shield': int,
                                    'captain': str}

assert get_type_hints(Starship.__init__) == {'captain': str,
                                             'return': None}
</pre>
<p>Note that if annotations are not found statically, then the
<tt class="docutils literal">__annotations__</tt> dictionary is not created at all. Also the
value of having annotations available locally does not offset
the cost of having to create and populate the annotations dictionary
on every function call. Therefore annotations at function level are
not evaluated and not stored.</p>
<div class="section" id="other-uses-of-annotations">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id16">Other uses of annotations</a></h2>
<p>While Python with this PEP will not object to:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
alice: 'well done' = 'A+'
bob: 'what a shame' = 'F-'
</pre>
<p>since it will not care about the type annotation beyond &quot;it evaluates

unless disabled with <tt class="docutils literal"># type: ignore</tt> or <tt class="docutils literal">&#64;no_type_check</tt>.</p>
<p>However, since Python won't care what the &quot;type&quot; is,
if the above snippet is at the global level or in a class, <tt class="docutils literal">__annotations__</tt>
will include <tt class="docutils literal">{'alice': 'well done', 'bob': 'what a shame'}</tt>.</p>
<p>These stored annotations might be used for other purposes,
but with this PEP we explicitly recommend type hinting as the
preferred use of annotations.</p>

<span id="rejected"></span><h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id17">Rejected/Postponed Proposals</a></h1>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Should we introduce variable annotations at all?</strong>
Variable annotations have <em>already</em> been around for almost two years
in the form of type comments, sanctioned by <a class="reference external" href="/dev/peps/pep-0484">PEP 484</a>.  They are
extensively used by third party type checkers (mypy, pytype,
PyCharm, etc.) and by projects using the type checkers. However, the
comment syntax has many downsides listed in Rationale. This PEP is
not about the need for type annotations, it is about what should be
the syntax for such annotations.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Introduce a new keyword:</strong>
The choice of a good keyword is hard,
e.g. it can't be <tt class="docutils literal">var</tt> because that is way too common a variable name,
and it can't be <tt class="docutils literal">local</tt> if we want to use it for class variables or
globals. Second, no matter what we choose, we'd still need
a <tt class="docutils literal">__future__</tt> import.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Use</strong> <tt class="docutils literal">def</tt> <strong>as a keyword:</strong>
The proposal would be:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
def primes: List[int] = []
def captain: str
</pre>
<p>The problem with this is that <tt class="docutils literal">def</tt> means &quot;define a function&quot; to
generations of Python programmers (and tools!), and using it also to
define variables does not increase clarity.  (Though this is of
course subjective.)</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Use function based syntax</strong>:
It was proposed to annotate types of variables using
<tt class="docutils literal">var = cast(annotation[, value])</tt>. Although this syntax
alleviates some problems with type comments like absence of the annotation
in AST, it does not solve other problems such as readability
and it introduces possible runtime overhead.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Allow type annotations for tuple unpacking:</strong>
This causes ambiguity: it's not clear what this statement means:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
x, y: T
</pre>
<p>Are <tt class="docutils literal">x</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">y</tt> both of type <tt class="docutils literal">T</tt>, or do we expect <tt class="docutils literal">T</tt> to be
a tuple type of two items that are distributed over <tt class="docutils literal">x</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">y</tt>,
or perhaps <tt class="docutils literal">x</tt> has type <tt class="docutils literal">Any</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">y</tt> has type <tt class="docutils literal">T</tt>? (The
latter is what this would mean if this occurred in a function
signature.)  Rather than leave the (human) reader guessing, we
forbid this, at least for now.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Parenthesized form</strong> <tt class="docutils literal">(var: type)</tt> <strong>for annotations:</strong>
It was brought up on python-ideas as a remedy for the above-mentioned
ambiguity, but it was rejected since such syntax would be hairy,
the benefits are slight, and the readability would be poor.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Allow annotations in chained assignments:</strong>
This has problems of ambiguity and readability similar to tuple
unpacking, for example in:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
x: int = y = 1
z = w: int = 1
</pre>
<p>it is ambiguous, what should the types of <tt class="docutils literal">y</tt> and  <tt class="docutils literal">z</tt> be?
Also the second line is difficult to parse.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Allow annotations in</strong> <tt class="docutils literal">with</tt> <strong>and</strong> <tt class="docutils literal">for</tt> <strong>statement:</strong>
This was rejected because in <tt class="docutils literal">for</tt> it would make it hard to spot the actual
iterable, and in <tt class="docutils literal">with</tt> it would confuse the CPython's LL(1) parser.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Evaluate local annotations at function definition time:</strong>
This has been rejected by Guido because the placement of the annotation
strongly suggests that it's in the same scope as the surrounding code.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Store variable annotations also in function scope:</strong>
The value of having the annotations available locally is just not enough
to significantly offset the cost of creating and populating the dictionary
on <em>each</em> function call.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Initialize variables annotated without assignment:</strong>
It was proposed on python-ideas to initialize <tt class="docutils literal">x</tt> in <tt class="docutils literal">x: int</tt> to
<tt class="docutils literal">None</tt> or to an additional special constant like Javascript's
<tt class="docutils literal">undefined</tt>. However, adding yet another singleton value to the language
would needed to be checked for everywhere in the code. Therefore,
Guido just said plain &quot;No&quot; to this.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Add also</strong> <tt class="docutils literal">InstanceVar</tt> <strong>to the typing module:</strong>
This is redundant because instance variables are way more common than
class variables. The more common usage deserves to be the default.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Allow instance variable annotations only in methods:</strong>
The problem is that many <tt class="docutils literal">__init__</tt> methods do a lot of things besides
initializing instance variables, and it would be harder (for a human)
to find all the instance variable annotations.
And sometimes <tt class="docutils literal">__init__</tt> is factored into more helper methods
so it's even harder to chase them down. Putting the instance variable
annotations together in the class makes it easier to find them,
and helps a first-time reader of the code.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Use syntax</strong> <tt class="docutils literal">x: class t = v</tt> <strong>for class variables:</strong>
This would require a more complicated parser and the <tt class="docutils literal">class</tt>
keyword would confuse simple-minded syntax highlighters. Anyway we
need to have <tt class="docutils literal">ClassVar</tt> store class variables to
<tt class="docutils literal">__annotations__</tt>, so a simpler syntax was chosen.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Forget about</strong> <tt class="docutils literal">ClassVar</tt> <strong>altogether:</strong>
This was proposed since mypy seems to be getting along fine without a way
to distinguish between class and instance variables. But a type checker
can do useful things with the extra information, for example flag
accidental assignments to a class variable via the instance
(which would create an instance variable shadowing the class variable).
It could also flag instance variables with mutable defaults,
a well-known hazard.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Use</strong> <tt class="docutils literal">ClassAttr</tt> <strong>instead of</strong> <tt class="docutils literal">ClassVar</tt>:
The main reason why <tt class="docutils literal">ClassVar</tt> is better is following: many things are
class attributes, e.g. methods, descriptors, etc. But only specific
attributes are conceptually class variables (or maybe constants).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Do not evaluate annotations, treat them as strings:</strong>
This would be inconsistent with the behavior of function annotations that
are always evaluated. Although this might be reconsidered in future,
it was decided in <a class="reference external" href="/dev/peps/pep-0484">PEP 484</a> that this would have to be a separate PEP.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Annotate variable types in class docstring:</strong>
Many projects already use various docstring conventions, often without
much consistency and generally without conforming to the <a class="reference external" href="/dev/peps/pep-0484">PEP 484</a> annotation
syntax yet. Also this would require a special sophisticated parser.
This, in turn, would defeat the purpose of the PEP --
collaborating with the third party type checking tools.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Implement</strong> <tt class="docutils literal">__annotations__</tt> <strong>as a descriptor:</strong>
This was proposed to prohibit setting <tt class="docutils literal">__annotations__</tt> to something
non-dictionary or non-None. Guido has rejected this idea as unnecessary;
instead a TypeError will be raised if an attempt is made to update
<tt class="docutils literal">__annotations__</tt> when it is anything other than a mapping.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Treating bare annotations the same as global or nonlocal:</strong>
The rejected proposal would prefer that the presence of an
annotation without assignment in a function body should not involve
<em>any</em> evaluation.  In contrast, the PEP implies that if the target
is more complex than a single name, its &quot;left-hand part&quot; should be
evaluated at the point where it occurs in the function body, just to
enforce that it is defined.  For example, in this example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
def foo(self):
    slef.name: str
</pre>
<p>the name <tt class="docutils literal">slef</tt> should be evaluated, just so that if it is not
defined (as is likely in this example :-), the error will be caught
at runtime.  This is more in line with what happens when there <em>is</em>
an initial value, and thus is expected to lead to fewer surprises.
(Also note that if the target was <tt class="docutils literal">self.name</tt> (this time correctly
spelled :-), an optimizing compiler has no obligation to evaluate
<tt class="docutils literal">self</tt> as long as it can prove that it will definitely be
defined.)</p>
