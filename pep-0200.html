<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id2">Introduction</a></h1>
<p>This PEP describes the Python 2.0 release schedule, tracking the
status and ownership of the major new features, summarizes discussions
held in mailing list forums, and provides URLs for further
information, patches, and other outstanding issues.  The CVS revision
history of this file contains the definitive historical record.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="release-schedule">

<p>[revised 5 Oct 2000]</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>26-Sep-2000: 2.0 beta 2</li>
<li>9-Oct-2000: 2.0 release candidate 1 (2.0c1)</li>

</div>
<div class="section" id="what-is-release-candidate-1">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5">What is release candidate 1?</a></h1>
<p>We believe that release candidate 1 will fix all known bugs that we
intend to fix for the 2.0 final release.  This release should be a bit
more stable than the previous betas.  We would like to see even more
widespread testing before the final release, so we are producing this
release candidate.  The final release will be exactly the same unless
any show-stopping (or brown bag) bugs are found by testers of the
release candidate.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="guidelines-for-submitting-patches-and-making-changes">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6">Guidelines for submitting patches and making changes</a></h1>
<p>Use good sense when committing changes.  You should know what we mean
by good sense or we wouldn't have given you commit privileges &lt;0.5
wink&gt;.  Some specific examples of good sense include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Do whatever the dictator tells you.</li>
<li>Discuss any controversial changes on python-dev first.  If you get
a lot of +1 votes and no -1 votes, make the change.  If you get a
some -1 votes, think twice; consider asking Guido what he thinks.</li>
<li>If the change is to code you contributed, it probably makes sense
for you to fix it.</li>
<li>If the change affects code someone else wrote, it probably makes
sense to ask him or her first.</li>
<li>You can use the SF Patch Manager to submit a patch and assign it to
someone for review.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any significant new feature must be described in a PEP and approved
before it is checked in.</p>
<p>Any significant code addition, such as a new module or large patch,
must include test cases for the regression test and documentation.  A
patch should not be checked in until the tests and documentation are
ready.</p>
<p>If you fix a bug, you should write a test case that would have caught
the bug.</p>
<p>If you commit a patch from the SF Patch Manager or fix a bug from the
Jitterbug database, be sure to reference the patch/bug number in the
CVS log message.  Also be sure to change the status in the patch
manager or bug database (if you have access to the bug database).</p>
<p>It is not acceptable for any checked in code to cause the regression
test to fail.  If a checkin causes a failure, it must be fixed within
24 hours or it will be backed out.</p>
<p>All contributed C code must be ANSI C.  If possible check it with two
different compilers, e.g. gcc and MSVC.</p>
<p>All contributed Python code must follow Guido's Python style guide.
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/doc/essays/styleguide.html">http://www.python.org/doc/essays/styleguide.html</a></p>
<p>It is understood that any code contributed will be released under an
Open Source license.  Do not contribute code if it can't be released
this way.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="failing-test-cases-need-to-get-fixed">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id7">Failing test cases need to get fixed</a></h1>
<p>We need to resolve errors in the regression test suite quickly.
Changes should not be committed to the CVS tree unless the regression
test runs cleanly with the changes applied.  If it fails, there may be
bugs lurking in the code.  (There may be bugs anyway, but that's
another matter.)  If the test cases are known to fail, they serve no
useful purpose.</p>

test_popen2       Win32       26-Jul-2000
    [31-Aug-2000 tim
     This died again, but for an entirely different reason:  it uses a
     dict to map file pointers to process handles, and calls a dict
     access function during popen.close().  But .close releases threads,
     which left the internal popen code accessing the dict without a
     valid thread state.  The dict implementation changed so that's no
     longer accepted.  Fixed by creating a temporary thread state in the
     guts of popen's close routine, and grabbing the global lock with
     it for the duration]
    [20-Aug-2000 tim
     changed the popen2.py _test function to use the &quot;more&quot; cmd
     when os.name == &quot;nt&quot;.  This makes test_popen2 pass under
     Win98SE.
     HOWEVER, the Win98 &quot;more&quot; invents a leading newline out
     of thin air, and I'm not sure that the other Windows flavors
     of &quot;more&quot; also do that.
     So, somebody please try under other Windows flavors!
    ]
    [still fails 15-Aug-2000 for me, on Win98 - tim
         test test_popen2 crashed -- exceptions.AssertionError :
     The problem is that the test uses &quot;cat&quot;, but there is
     no such thing under Windows (unless you install it).
     So it's the test that's broken here, not (necessarily)
     the code.

    [18-Aug-2000, tim:  can't reproduce, and nobody else

     regrtest.py when using -v, and I'll pursue that,
     but can't provoke anything wrong with test_longexp
     anymore; eyeballing Fred's changes didn't turn up
     a suspect either
     19-Aug-2000, tim: the &quot;subtle bug&quot; in regrtest.py -v is
     actually a feature:  -v masks *some* kinds of failures,
     since it doesn't compare test output with the canned
     output; this is what makes it say &quot;test passed&quot; even
     in some cases where the test fails without -v

    [20-Aug-2000 tim - the test has been removed from the project]
    [19-Aug-2000 tim
     This test will never work on Win98, because it's looking for
     a part of registry that doesn't exist under W98.
     The module (winreg.py) and this test case will be removed
     before 2.0 for other reasons, though.

Windows installer:  If HKLM isn't writable, back off to HKCU (so
Python can be installed on NT &amp; 2000 without admin privileges).

[01-Sep-200 tim - as Guido said, runtime code in posixmodule.c doesn't
 call this on NT/2000, so no need to avoid installing it everywhere.
 Added code to the installer *to* install it, though.]
Windows installer:  Install w9xpopen.exe only under Win95/98.

Windows:  Look for registry info in HKCU before HKLM - Mark
Hammond.

[20-Aug-2000 tim - done]
Remove winreg.py and test_winreg2.py.  Paul Prescod (the author)
now wants to make a registry API more like the MS .NET API.  Unclear
whether that can be done in time for 2.0, but, regardless, if we
let winreg.py out the door we'll be stuck with it forever, and not
even Paul wants it anymore.
